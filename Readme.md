## Team Workflow Strategy

We plan on using a main branch, development branch, hotfix branch and feature branches 

The main branch will consist of the final version of the project

The development branch will consist of the in-progress project, this merges into main

The hotfix branch will be used in case any urgent or small fixes are needed. This merges into main.

Individual branches will be created for every feature, upon completion (development and testing), these branches are merged into the development branch. 

We plan on regularly discussing what features each of us will work on as the project progresses as well as discussing progress on feature development.
